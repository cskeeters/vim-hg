*hg.txt*	Plugin for accessing mercurial information

This plugin speeds up the process of using mercurial to discover the commit
that affected the current line in the current file.

The current directory in vim must be in the same mercurial root as the current
file when the plugin is run.

This plugin requires mercurial and the hgextras package which adds chad and
chad_text styles for hg log.

						*hg-mappings*
The following mapping is suggested:

nmap <localleader>b <Plug>HgAnnotate
	Opens a new buffer displaying log and diff information for the commit
        that added the current line in its current form.

nmap <localleader>d <Plug>HgDiff
	This is used to show a full diff of the revision number on the current
        line.  This would normally be used after running <Plug>HgAnnotate

						*hg_credit*
